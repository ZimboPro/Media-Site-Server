# Media-Site-Server
A project to allow media on a harddrive to streamed to a website and be accessed from on the local network

## Vision
This project is to help me learn more about Angular and .Net Core. The final state is to have this run/deployed
on a raspberry pi on the local network and allow any device to connect and view the media stored. I also hope
to allow media to be added while still running. Also to have the media descriptions, posters rating etc gathered
from the internet for a more pleasurable experience for users

# Note
If you have any suggestions that can make this better such as user experience, better method of doing in the software
 please let me know. While I learn the tech stack I also want to learn about system design, architectural design,
 software design etc. If you want to help create this let me know as well.
