# Media-Site-Server
A project to allow media on a harddrive to streamed to a website and be accessed from on the local network

## Vision
This project is to help me learn more about Angular and .Net Core. The final state is to have this run/deployed
on a raspberry pi on the local network and allow any device to connect and view the media stored. I also hope
to allow media to be added while still running. Also to have the media descriptions, posters rating etc gathered
from the internet for a more pleasurable experience for users
